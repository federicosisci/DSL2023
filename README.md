# Predicting Online News Popularity 

Hi, we are Federico Sisci and Gioele Costa, two students of Politecnico of Turin.
In this paper we propose our approach to the problem of predicting the number of shares of online articles. First we focus on data exploration in order to manage possible issues in the dataset, then we compare the performance of basic regression models so as to choose a starting optimal estimator. Finally we improve our regressor through feature selection and we perform the predictions on the evaluation set.
